    // --- The Pitfall: Excessive Cloning ---
    // The function `process_owned` takes full ownership.
    // If we want to use `data` again later, we are FORCED to clone it.
    // This performs a "Deep Copy", duplicating the entire 1MB payload on the heap.
    
    // process_owned(data.clone()); // Slow: Allocation + Copy
    
    // println!("Original data ID is still here: {}", data.id);

    // --- The Fix: Pass by Reference (Borrowing) ---
    // The function `process_borrowed` takes a reference (&LargeData).
    // We pass a pointer to the existing data. No new heap allocation occurs.
    
    process_borrowed(&data); // Fast: Pointer copy only
    
    println!("Original data ID is still here: {}", data.id);

fn process_owned(d: LargeData) {
    println!("Processing owned ID: {}", d.id);

}

// Good Practice: Borrows the data for reading
