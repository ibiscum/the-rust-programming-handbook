// IMPORTANT: To run this code, you must add the `futures` crate to your Cargo.toml:
//
// [dependencies]
// futures = "0.3"

use std::future::Future;
use std::time::Duration;
use std::thread::sleep; // We'll use this for a simple blocking sleep

// We need an executor to run our async functions.
// `block_on` is a simple one from the `futures` crate.

/// This is an async function. It returns a `Future`.
async fn fetch_simulated_data(task_id: u32) -> String {
    println!("Task {}: Starting fetch...", task_id);
    
    // In a real async function, we would .await an async operation here.
    // Since we don't have a full async runtime (like Tokio) setup here, 
    // we can't use an async sleep efficiently.
    // We'll just use a normal sleep to simulate work *within* this Future.
    // This is NOT true async non-blocking sleep, but it shows the structure.
    sleep(Duration::from_secs(1));
    
    println!("Task {}: Finished fetch.", task_id);

    let data2 = fetch_simulated_data(2).await;
